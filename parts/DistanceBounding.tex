\section{Distance Bounding Protocols}

Distance bounding protocols are interactive protocols that aim to measure the physical distance or latency between the participants. They're latency measurement protocols that are solutions to problems where a simple ping won't suffice, as either party could quite easily cause a false measurement. Distance bounding is used in applications like IP geolocation, RFID and other wireless authentication, plus routing in P2P (ad-hoc) networks.
