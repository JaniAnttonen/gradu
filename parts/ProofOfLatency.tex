\chapter{Proof of Latency}
\label{Proof of Latency}

Proof of Latency is a algorithm that uses an asynchronically stoppable verifiable delay function as its basis. The calculated amount of squarings until the VDF is stopped serves as a publicly verifiable measurement metric for latency between two peers.
