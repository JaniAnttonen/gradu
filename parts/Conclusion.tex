\label{Conclusion}
Since calculating a VDF is relatively easy for modern processors, a VDF over as little as a few milliseconds of time can be a valid way of measuring latency. Still, without an ASIC chip for calculating VDFs faster than any other available processor, Proof of Latency is also a measurement of processing performance. This might introduce an unfortunate barrier for entry for mobile and IoT devices. When used in P2P routing optimization, PoL will result in a network topology organized by a gradient that is defined by geographical location, network connection speed and the similarity in performance between peers.

This means closely located and similarly performant devices form strong local topologies that are bridged by their random connections to other peers and also by the connections they have to performant local peers. Highly performant devices form strong connections with each other whether they are located near each other or not, because other devices cannot compete against them in the race that is Proof of Latency, resulting in a network topology that is locally effective but global at the same time. The reality that VDFs can't be sped up by additional processors or cores means that the gradient will not be as drastic as one might imagine.

Proof of Latency as a peer scoring metric not only protects peers from eclipse attacks, but can also function as a way of speeding up the initial bootstrapping process by bringing peers more closely together. This also makes the resulting P2P network more robust, due to its locality, in instances of internet stoppages between continents, censorship, or high network load. When used to prove a geographical location, Proof of Latency can combat fraud in applications that rely on GPS location.

\section{Future Considerations}
If this system was integrated to a blockchain or a publicly verifiable source of randomness for the initial setup, the proofs could be verified by anyone against consensus. Not only this would add trust to the latency measurements, but also speed up initial bootstrapping of the P2P network. When P2P networks eventually grow larger and larger, the network bootstrapping logic needs to be rethought to handle more traffic, be more decentralized, and be faster in its initialization. By getting introduced to the closest peers possible right at the start the user can experience a more performant network faster, lowering the barrier for entry and making first impressions better.

Also, I believe the work is not cryptographically as secure as it could be, and the field is progressing at a mindnumbing pace. Making sure the algorithm is VDF-agnostic would be a logical next step, since the field is still in progress of finding the best possible formulation of a VDF. Quantum computing can, or will, render all existing VDF types insufficient, and new VDF types could change the parameter logic fundamentally.
