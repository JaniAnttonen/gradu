\section{History}
Verifiable delay functions are based on time-lock puzzles. Time-lock puzzles are computational sequential puzzles that require a certain amount of time to solve.\cite{Rivest_undated-qr} Time-lock puzzles

Verifiable delay functions fall under the same definition, but introduce a publicly verifiable proof that is much faster to verify than the puzzle was to solve.

\section{Applications}

Many have shown that there are more use cases for these algoritms than puzzles and random number generators. Some examples include preventing front running in p2p cryptocurrency exchanges, spam prevention and rate limiting\cite{noauthor_undated-hk}

All of these applications can be made faster with hardware, and it has been estimated that with an ASIC chip a VDF can be calculated more than ten times faster than with a GPU. If or when hardware specifically optimized for sequential squarings is commercialized, VDFs can become much more mainstream, and suffer less from competition, thus requiring less trust between the calculating parties.

\section{Variations}


\section{Similar Constructs}
A VDF can only be calculated sequentially, but even without a proof there is a possibility to make the verification faster through parallellism. A non-verifiable delay function, or time-lock puzzle in short, can be still verified faster than the calculation, because there is no sequential requirement after the puzzle has been calculated, enabling to use multiple CPU cores or highly parallel graphics processing units for verifying the puzzle, like in Solana.\cite{Yakovenko2018-zn}
