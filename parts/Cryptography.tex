\chapter{Cryptography}
\label{Cryptography}

Cryptography is a field of mathematics that uses computationally difficult problems to obfuscate, hide, split and verify data. Starting in the ancient times with the famous Caesar cipher, which relied on shifting the letters in a message in coordination to an alphabet, there are multiple cryptographic protocols today for a variety of use cases, which are used in both public and private messaging. As mentioned earlier, while the familiar connotation of cryptography as a word brings secrecy and secure communications into mind, it can also be used to verify data, and to prove that something has happened. I will go over cryptography subjects that are relevant to the Proof of Latency protocol in this chapter, like groups of unknown order, RSA and cryptographic proofs. 

% TODO: Nobody can understand crypto based on this definition. Start with an explanation that foresees what the chapter will contain.
Modern cryptography is based on relatively few mathematical fundamentals. The most dominant one during the age of computers has been prime numbers with modular multiplication, but elliptic curve cryptography is used widely today because of its easy and less resource-intensive key generation method when compared to the prime number based RSA cryptosystem. They both use modular arithmetic in their operations.

Modular\footnote{Using the modulus operation; taking the remainder of a division. Useful in cryptography because it creates finite cyclical groups.} arithmetic with large numbers has a useful property that you can exchange encrypted data without the participants knowing each other's private keys, but requiring a computation that is theoretically almost impossible to break due to the prime factorization problem.  Prime numbers and elliptic curves can be used to create the variables used in modular multiplication, providing the basis for the robustness of the cryptosystem.

\section{Groups of Unknown Order}


\subsection{RSA}
RSA is named after it's discoverers – Rivest, Shamir, Adleman. It is an asymmetric public-key cryptosystem, meaning that it is based on a keypair, in which one is a public and the other is a secret. The public key is used to encrypt, and the secret key is used to decrypt. Everyone who has the public key can encrypt data and that encrypted data is practically impossible to decrypt without the secret key. This works due to the fact that it is hard to factor the product of two large prime numbers. RSA has been the most widely used cryptosystem since its creation, and is easy to use in modern context by just modifying the size of the keys.

RSA is an arithmetic trick that creates a mathematical object called a trapdoor permutation. Trapdoor permutation is a function that transforms a number x to a number y in the same range, in a way that computing y from x is easy using the public key but computing x from y is practically impossible without knowing the private key. The private key is the trapdoor.~\cite{Aumasson2018-nh}
% TODO: Reader thinks what the hell is the next paragraph about, try to open things up a bit before going into factoring competitions, although they play a big part in VDF history

The company formed by the RSA algorithm's inventors, RSA Security LLC, published public RSA semiprimes\footnote{A product of two prime numbers} that are called RSA numbers as a part of the RSA factoring challenge from 1991 up until 2007 when the challenge ended.~\cite{RSA_Laboratories2013-zk} The challenge was ended because it had reached its purpose of forwarding science and understanding of common symmetric-key and public-key algorithms. Despite this, still under a half of the RSA numbers have been factored, and the largest of them might take hundreds if not even thousands of years to break even when given extraordinary hardware to do it with.

Given that the RSA numbers are said to have been created with a machine that was completely destroyed after their creation and the primes were never apparent to anyone, you need to trust the company's claims if you ever use these public challenge numbers. Fortunately, usually they are not used for encrypting large swathes of personal data, but in a more ephemeral context like Proof of Latency, which wouldn't cause a huge stir if the cryptosystem was broken and needed changing.

\section{Proofs}
Cryptographic proofs are proofs that depend on the trapdoor nature of cryptographic functions. The most well-known proofs, which are not necessarily thought of as such are cryptographic signatures. Given a public key, a computer in posession of its corresponding private key can produce a signature of any given data, implying together with the data that the computer has seen and processed the data.

Proofs can be private or public. A cryptographic proof can be categorized as public, if a verifier can gather all information required to verify the proof from the transcript of the proof itself, and verify the proof to be correct. Now, since classical cryptography is based on the fact that a computation is asymmetric --- being harder to compute the other way around, a cryptographic proof is still probabilistic in nature, and the security of it based not only on the algorithm but also the parameters used.
