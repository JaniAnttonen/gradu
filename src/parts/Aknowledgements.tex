First of all, this thesis would not have been made unless for my friends and colleagues at Equilibrium who enable me to work on the most interesting stuff on the planet. Thanks to Aurora, my friends, mom and dad, for inspiring me to pursue goals that at first might seem too difficult. This might have not helped with the deadlines at times but it surely helps with the end result.

I would like to thank Justin at VDF Alliance for introing my desire for a thesis around verifiable delay functions to Kelly and Simon at Supranational, who guided me towards and gave ideas for a research subject. Huge thanks for them for the continued interest in my work and efforts in improving the algorithms and hardware around VDFs. Thanks to Samuli for the extracurricular reviews and sparring me on cryptographic proofs and vector commitments. It ultimately was what helped me to transform a distance bounding algorithm to an actual cryptographic proof.
