  title    = "Comprehending Kademlia Routing - A Theoretical Framework for the
              Hop Count Distribution",
  author   = "Roos, Stefanie and Salah, Hani and Strufe, Thorsten",
  abstract = "The family of Kademlia-type systems represents the most efficient
              and most widely deployed class of internet-scale distributed
              systems. Its success has caused plenty of large scale
              measurements and simulation studies, and several improvements
              have been introduced. Its character of parallel and
              non-deterministic lookups, however, so far has prevented any
              concise formal analysis. This paper introduces the first
              comprehensive formal model of the routing of the entire family of
              systems that is validated against previous measurements. It sheds
              light on the overall hop distribution and lookup delays of the
              different variations of the original protocol. It additionally
              shows that several of the recent improvements to the protocol in
              fact have been counter-productive and identifies preferable
              designs with regard to routing overhead and resilience.",

  author   = "Cai, Xing Shi and Devroye, Luc",
  abstract = "Kademlia is the de facto standard searching algorithm for P2P
              (peer-to-peer) networks on the Internet. In our earlier work, we
              introduced two slightly different models for Kademlia and studied
              how many steps it takes to search for a target node by using
              Kademlia's searching algorithm. The first model, in which nodes
              of the network are labelled with deterministic IDs, had been
              discussed in that paper. The second one, in which nodes are
              labelled with random IDs, which we call the Random ID Model, was
              only briefly mentioned. Refined results with detailed proofs for
              this model are given in this paper. Our analysis shows that with
              high probability it takes about $c \log n$ steps to locate any
              node, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the network and
              $c$ is a constant that does not depend on $n$.",

              it is necessary to transmit a key, by secret means, before

              method is described which forces any enemy to expend an amount of
              work which increases as the square of the work required of the
              two communicants to select the key. The method provides a
              logically new kind of protection against the passive
              eavesdropper. It suggests that further research on this topic

              security of the Ethereum ecosystem has been studied in the past,
              the network layer has been mostly neglected. We show that Go
              Ethereum (Geth), the most widely used Ethereum implementation, is
              vulnerable to eclipse attacks, effectively circumventing recently
              introduced (Geth v1.8.0) security enhancements. We responsibly
              disclosed the vulnerability to core Ethereum developers; the
              corresponding countermeasures to our attack where incorporated
              into the v1.9.0 release of Geth. Our false friends attack
              exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth
              and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote
              victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24
              subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to
              filter the victim's view of the Blockchain. We discuss
              fundamental properties of Geth's node discovery logic that enable
              the false friends attack, as well as proposed and implemented
              countermeasures.",

              that provides bi-directional 'third-party' sender and receiver
              anonymity and unobservability. Loopix leverages cover traffic and
              brief message delays to provide anonymity and achieve traffic
              analysis resistance, including against a global network
              adversary. Mixes and clients self-monitor the network via loops
              of traffic to provide protection against active attacks, and
              inject cover traffic to provide stronger anonymity and a measure
              of sender and receiver unobservability. Service providers mediate
              access in and out of a stratified network of Poisson mix nodes to
              facilitate accounting and off-line message reception, as well as
              to keep the number of links in the system low, and to concentrate
              cover traffic. We provide a theoretical analysis of the Poisson
              mixing strategy as well as an empirical evaluation of the
              anonymity provided by the protocol and a functional
              implementation that we analyze in terms of scalability by running
              it on AWS EC2. We show that a Loopix relay can handle upwards of
              300 messages per second, at a small delay overhead of less than
              1.5 ms on top of the delays introduced into messages to provide
              security. Overall message latency is in the order of seconds -
              which is low for a mix-system. Furthermore, many mix nodes can be
              securely added to a stratified topology to scale throughput

                are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a malicious
                user pretends to have multiple identities (called sybil nodes).
                Without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil
                attacks is quite challenging. Among the small number of
                decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard protocol [H. Yu
                et al., 2006] leverages a key insight on social networks to
                bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its
                direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of
                sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard assumes
                that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been
                confirmed in the real world. This paper presents the novel
                SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as
                SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal
                guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a
                factor of ominus(radicn), or around 200 times in our
                experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that
                SybilLimit's guarantee is at most a log n factor away from
                optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing
                social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world
                social networks, we provide the first evidence that real-world
                social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the
                fundamental assumption behind SybilLimit's and SybilGuard's
                approach.",

              in TLS, Bitcoin and elsewhere. Unlike other schemes like RSA,
              Schnorr signatures and more, it is particularly hard to construct
              efficient threshold signature protocols for ECDSA (and DSA). As a
              result, the best-known protocols today for secure distributed
              ECDSA require running heavy zero-knowledge proofs and computing
              many large-modulus exponentiations for every signing operation.
              In this paper, we consider the specific case of two parties (and
              thus no honest majority) and construct a protocol that is
              approximately \textbackslashtextit\{two orders of magnitude
              faster\} than the previous best. Concretely, our protocol
              achieves good performance, with a single signing operation for

              machine types in Azure (utilizing a single core only). Our

               integers k, and the discrete logarithm logb a is an integer k
               such that bk = a. In number theory, the more commonly used term
               is index: we can write x = indr a (mod m) (read the index of a
               to the base r modulo m) for rx $\equiv$ a (mod m) if r is a
               primitive root of m and gcd(a,m) = 1. Discrete logarithms are
               quickly computable in a few special cases. However, no efficient
               method is known for computing them in general. Several important
               algorithms in public-key cryptography base their security on the
               assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully
               chosen groups has no efficient solution.",

  abstract  = "In cryptography, the Fiat--Shamir heuristic is a technique for
               taking an interactive proof of knowledge and creating a digital
               signature based on it. This way, some fact (for example,
               knowledge of a certain secret number) can be publicly proven
               without revealing underlying information. The technique is due
               to Amos Fiat and Adi Shamir (1986). For the method to work, the
               original interactive proof must have the property of being
               public-coin, i.e. verifier's random coins are made public
               throughout the proof protocol. The heuristic was originally
               presented without a proof of security; later, Pointcheval and
               Stern proved its security against chosen message attacks in the
               random oracle model, that is, assuming random oracles exist.
               This result was generalized to the quantum-accessible random
               oracle (QROM) by Don, Fehr, Majenz and Schaffner, and
               concurrently by Liu and Zhandry. In the case that random oracles
               do not exist, the Fiat--Shamir heuristic has been proven
               insecure by Shafi Goldwasser and Yael Tauman Kalai. The
               Fiat--Shamir heuristic thus demonstrates a major application of
               random oracles. More generally, the Fiat--Shamir heuristic may
               also be viewed as converting a public-coin interactive proof of
               knowledge into a non-interactive proof of knowledge. If the
               interactive proof is used as an identification tool, then the
               non-interactive version can be used directly as a digital
               signature by using the message as part of the input to the
               random oracle.",

  title     = "Commitment scheme",
  booktitle = "Wikipedia",
  abstract  = "A commitment scheme is a cryptographic primitive that allows one
               to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping
               it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed
               value later. Commitment schemes are designed so that a party
               cannot change the value or statement after they have committed
               to it: that is, commitment schemes are binding. Commitment
               schemes have important applications in a number of cryptographic
               protocols including secure coin flipping, zero-knowledge proofs,
               and secure computation. A way to visualize a commitment scheme
               is to think of a sender as putting a message in a locked box,
               and giving the box to a receiver. The message in the box is
               hidden from the receiver, who cannot open the lock themselves.
               Since the receiver has the box, the message inside cannot be
               changed---merely revealed if the sender chooses to give them the
               key at some later time. Interactions in a commitment scheme take
               place in two phases: the commit phase during which a value is
               chosen and specified the reveal phase during which the value is
               revealed and checkedIn simple protocols, the commit phase
               consists of a single message from the sender to the receiver.
               This message is called the commitment. It is essential that the
               specific value chosen cannot be known by the receiver at that
               time (this is called the hiding property). A simple reveal phase
               would consist of a single message, the opening, from the sender
               to the receiver, followed by a check performed by the receiver.
               The value chosen during the commit phase must be the only one
               that the sender can compute and that validates during the reveal
               phase (this is called the binding property). The concept of
               commitment schemes was perhaps first formalized by Gilles
               Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crepeau in 1988, as part of
               various Zero-Knowledge protocols for NP, based on various types
               of commitment schemes (see also: ). But the concept was used
               without being treated formally prior to that. The notion of
               commitments appeared earliest in works by Manuel Blum, Shimon
               Even, and Shamir et al. The terminology seems to have been
               originated by Blum, although commitment schemes can be
               interchangeably called bit commitment schemes---sometimes
               reserved for the special case where the committed value is a
               bit. Earlier to that, commitment via one-way hash functions was
               considered, e.g., as part of, say, Lamport signature, the
               original one-time one-bit signature scheme.",

  abstract  = "Diffie--Hellman key exchange is a method of securely exchanging
               cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the
               first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and
               named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of
               the earliest practical examples of public key exchange
               implemented within the field of cryptography. Traditionally,
               secure encrypted communication between two parties required that
               they first exchange keys by some secure physical means, such as
               paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The
               Diffie--Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have
               no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared
               secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used
               to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key
               cipher. Diffie--Hellman is used to secure a variety of Internet
               services. However, research published in October 2015 suggests
               that the parameters in use for many DH Internet applications at
               that time are not strong enough to prevent compromise by very
               well-funded attackers, such as the security services of large
               governments.The scheme was published by Whitfield Diffie and
               Martin Hellman in 1976, but in 1997 it was revealed that James
               H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm J. Williamson of GCHQ, the
               British signals intelligence agency, had previously shown in
               1969 how public-key cryptography could be achieved.Although
               Diffie--Hellman key agreement itself is a non-authenticated
               key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of
               authenticated protocols, and is used to provide forward secrecy
               in Transport Layer Security's ephemeral modes (referred to as
               EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite). The method was
               followed shortly afterwards by RSA, an implementation of
               public-key cryptography using asymmetric algorithms. Expired
               U.S. Patent 4,200,770 from 1977 describes the now public-domain

              of ``inherently sequential'' hash functions. Our protocol is
              based on a novel construction of time-lock puzzles. Given a
              sampled ``puzzle'' $P \gets D_n$, where $n$ is the security
              parameter and $D_n$ is the distribution of the puzzles, a
              corresponding ``solution'' can be generated using $N$ evaluations
              of the sequential hash function, where $N>n$ is another
              parameter, while any feasible adversarial strategy for generating
              valid solutions must take at least as much time as $\Omega(N)$
              *sequential* evaluations of the hash function after receiving
              $P$. Thus, valid solutions constitute a ``proof'' that
              $\Omega(N)$ parallel time elapsed since $P$ was received.
              Solutions can be publicly and efficiently verified in time
              $\poly(n) \cdot \polylog(N)$. Applications of these ``time-lock
              puzzles'' include noninteractive timestamping of documents (when
              the distribution over the possible documents corresponds to the
              puzzle distribution $D_n$) and universally verifiable CPU
              benchmarks. Our construction is secure in the standard model
              under complexity assumptions (collision-resistant hash functions
              and inherently sequential hash functions), and makes black-box
              use of the underlying primitives. Consequently, the corresponding
              construction in the random oracle model is secure
              unconditionally. Moreover, as it is a public-coin protocol, it
              can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model using the

              ``depth-robust'' directed acyclic graphs---ones whose depth
              remains large even after removing a constant fraction of
              vertices---which were previously studied for the purpose of
              complexity lower bounds. The construction bypasses a recent
              negative result of Mahmoody, Moran, and Vadhan (CRYPTO `11) for
              time-lock puzzles in the random oracle model, which showed that

  abstract = "Kademlia is a distributed hash table for decentralized
              peer-to-peer computer networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and
              David Mazi{\`e}res in 2002. It specifies the structure of the
              network and the exchange of information through node lookups.
              Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using UDP. A virtual
              or overlay network is formed by the participant nodes. Each node
              is identified by a number or node ID. The node ID serves not only
              as identification, but the Kademlia algorithm uses the node ID to
              locate values (usually file hashes or keywords). In fact, the
              node ID provides a direct map to file hashes and that node stores
              information on where to obtain the file or resource. When
              searching for some value, the algorithm needs to know the
              associated key and explores the network in several steps. Each
              step will find nodes that are closer to the key until the
              contacted node returns the value or no more closer nodes are
              found. This is very efficient: like many other DHTs, Kademlia
              contacts only O ( log ⁡ ( n ) ) \{\textbackslashdisplaystyle
              O(\textbackslashlog(n))\} nodes during the search out of a total
              of n \{\textbackslashdisplaystyle n\} nodes in the system.
              Further advantages are found particularly in the decentralized
              structure, which increases the resistance against a
              denial-of-service attack. Even if a whole set of nodes is
              flooded, this will have limited effect on network availability,
              since the network will recover itself by knitting the network
              around these ``holes''. I2P's implementation of Kademlia is
              modified to mitigate Kademlia's vulnerabilities, such as Sybil

  abstract = "A reliable source of randomness is a critical element in many
              cryptographic systems. A public randomness beacon is a randomness
              source generated in a distributed manner that satisfies the
              following requirements: Liveness, Unpredictability, Unbiasability
              and Public Verifiability. In this work we introduce HERB: a new
              randomness beacon protocol based on additively homomorphic
              encryption. We show that this protocol meets the requirements
              listed above and additionaly provides Guaranteed Output Delivery.
              HERB has a modular structure with two replaceable modules: an
              homomorphic cryptosystem and a consensus algorithm. In our
              analysis we instantiate HERB using ElGamal encryption and a
              public blockchain. We implemented a prototype using Cosmos SDK to
              demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of our approach. HERB
              allows splitting all protocol participants into two groups that
              can relate in any way. This property can be used for building
              more complex participation and reward systems based on the HERB
              solution.",

  abstract  = "In cryptography, a preimage attack on cryptographic hash
               functions tries to find a message that has a specific hash
               value. A cryptographic hash function should resist attacks on
               its preimage (set of possible inputs). In the context of attack,
               there are two types of preimage resistance: preimage resistance:
               for essentially all pre-specified outputs, it is computationally
               infeasible to find any input that hashes to that output, i.e.,
               given y, it is difficult to find an x such that h(x) = y.
               second-preimage resistance: it is computationally infeasible to
               find any second input which has the same output as that of a
               specified input, i.e., given x, it is difficult to find a second
               preimage x′ $\neq$ x such that h(x) = h(x′).These can be
               compared with a collision resistance, in which it is
               computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs x, x′
               that hash to the same output, i.e., such that h(x) =
               h(x′).Collision resistance implies second-preimage resistance,
               but does not guarantee preimage resistance. Conversely, a
               second-preimage attack implies a collision attack (trivially,
               since, in addition to x′, x is already known right from the
               start).",

  abstract  = "In computational complexity theory, an interactive proof system
               is an abstract machine that models computation as the exchange
               of messages between two parties. The parties, the verifier and
               the prover, interact by exchanging messages in order to
               ascertain whether a given string belongs to a language or not.
               The prover is all-powerful and possesses unlimited computational
               resources, but cannot be trusted, while the verifier has bounded
               computation power. Messages are sent between the verifier and
               prover until the verifier has an answer to the problem and has
               ``convinced'' itself that it is correct. All interactive proof
               systems have two requirements: Completeness: if the statement is
               true, the honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol
               properly) can be convinced of this fact by an untrusted prover.
               Soundness: if the statement is false, no prover, even if it
               doesn't follow the protocol, can convince the honest verifier
               that it is true, except with some small probability.It is
               assumed that the verifier is always honest. The specific nature
               of the system, and so the complexity class of languages it can
               recognize, depends on what sort of bounds are put on the
               verifier, as well as what abilities it is given---for example,
               most interactive proof systems depend critically on the
               verifier's ability to make random choices. It also depends on
               the nature of the messages exchanged---how many and what they
               can contain. Interactive proof systems have been found to have
               some important implications for traditional complexity classes
               defined using only one machine. The main complexity classes
               describing interactive proof systems are AM and IP.",

              applications given that the P2P decentralized design inherently
              fosters scalability and robustness. While distributiveness and
              scalability are attractive features, these facets also increase
              exposure to malicious peers which can propagate malicious routing
              information. Accordingly, a diverse set of continuously evolving
              attacks can be mounted that can cause severe service impairments
              over the entire overlay network. Most proposed countermeasures
              focus on providing diversity or redundancy to overcome malicious
              routing information with their emphasis on periodic
              detection/removal mechanisms done locally within a peer as
              continuous monitoring or global sharing of peer status entails
              high costs. However, a local approach naturally also limits the
              global effectiveness prompting the need for distributed
              solutions. In this work, we build upon contemporary distributed
              solutions (that developed specific attack detection and
              mitigation techniques for specific overlay types and specific
              attacks), to propose a generalized attack detection and
              mitigation approach applicable to varied overlay and attack

              attack variant, lookup approach or a specific victim set, (b)
              continuously detects and subsequently removes malicious routing
              information based on distributed quorum decisions, and (c)
              efficiently forwards malicious information findings to other
              peers which allows for progressive global sanitizing. The
              generalized mechanism shows a high sanitizing accuracy of up to
              90\% when evaluated against a generalized attack scenario with

              typically, based on techniques that combine cryptographic hashing

              a single prover), while preserving the time and space efficiency
              of the original MIP protocol; using our MIP protocol, this
              transformation yields a complexity-preserving four-message
              succinct argument. As a main tool for our transformation, we
              define and construct a \textbackslashemph\{succinct
              multi-function commitment\} that (a) allows the sender to commit
              to a vector of functions in time and space complexity that are
              essentially the same as those needed for a single evaluation of
              the functions, and (b) ensures that the receiver's running time
              is essentially independent of the function. The scheme is based
              on fully-homomorphic encryption (and no additional assumptions
              are needed for our succinct argument). (3) In addition, we
              revisit the problem of \textbackslashemph\{non-interactive\}
              succinct arguments of knowledge (SNARKs), where known
              impossibilities prevent solutions based on black-box reductions
              to standard assumptions. We formulate a natural (but
              non-standard) variant of homomorphic encryption having a
              \textbackslashemph\{homomorphism-extraction property\}. We show
              that this primitive essentially allows to squash our interactive
              protocol, while again preserving time and space efficiency,
              thereby obtaining a complexity-preserving SNARK. We further show
              that this variant is, in fact, implied by the existence of
              (complexity-preserving) SNARKs.",

  abstract  = "In cryptography, a preimage attack on cryptographic hash
               functions tries to find a message that has a specific hash
               value. A cryptographic hash function should resist attacks on
               its preimage (set of possible inputs). In the context of attack,
               there are two types of preimage resistance: preimage resistance:
               for essentially all pre-specified outputs, it is computationally
               infeasible to find any input that hashes to that output, i.e.,
               given y, it is difficult to find an x such that h(x) = y.
               second-preimage resistance: it is computationally infeasible to
               find any second input which has the same output as that of a
               specified input, i.e., given x, it is difficult to find a second
               preimage x′ $\neq$ x such that h(x) = h(x′).These can be
               compared with a collision resistance, in which it is
               computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs x, x′
               that hash to the same output, i.e., such that h(x) =
               h(x′).Collision resistance implies second-preimage resistance,
               but does not guarantee preimage resistance. Conversely, a
               second-preimage attack implies a collision attack (trivially,
               since, in addition to x′, x is already known right from the
               start).",

              components, consensus protocol is the defining technology behind
              the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental
              modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative
              alternative consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have
              been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain
              network itself or to accommodate other specific application
              needs. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and
              analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols.
              To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce
              the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of
              fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further
              discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain
              consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation,
              information propagation, block finalization, and incentive
              mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are
              then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions
              and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are
              analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with
              respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and
              comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental
              differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable
              application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance,
              scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey
              will provide blockchain developers and researchers a
              comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols
              and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.",

                transaction record to be reliably acquired by all nodes to
                prevent double-spending. Recently, many blockchains have been
                proposed to achieve scale-out throughput by letting nodes only
                acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However, these
                schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a
                degradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault
                tolerance. In this paper, we show that the complete set of
                transactions is not a necessity for the prevention of
                double-spending if the properties of value transfers is fully
                explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer ledger
                like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature
                without sacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we
                give a formal definition for the value-transfer ledger and its
                distinct features from a generic database. Then, we introduce
                the blockchain structure with a shared main chain for consensus
                and an individual chain for each node for recording
                transactions. A locally executable validation scheme is
                proposed with uncompromising validity and consistency. A
                beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will
                spontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only
                providing the transactions needed to show that their
                transactions are not double spend. As a result, the network is
                sharded as each node only acquires part of the transaction
                record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we
                call ``spontaneous sharding''.",

              Shard Blockchain Networks",
  author   = "Yun, Jusik and Goh, Yunyeong and Chung, Jong-Moon",
  abstract = "Blockchains guarantee data integrity through consensus of
              distributed ledgers based on multiple validation nodes called
              miners. For this reason, any blockchain system can be critically
              disabled by a malicious attack from a majority of the nodes
              (e.g., 51\% attack). These attacks are more likely to succeed as
              the number of nodes required for consensus is smaller. Recently,
              as blockchains are becoming too large (making them difficult to
              store, send, receive, and manage), sharding is being considered
              as a technology to help improve the transaction throughput and
              scalability of blockchains. Sharding distributes block validators
              to disjoint sets to process transactions in parallel. Therefore,
              the number of validators of each shard group is smaller, which
              makes shard-based blockchains more vulnerable to 51\% attacks
              than blockchains that do not use sharding. To solve this problem,
              this paper proposes a trust-based shard distribution (TBSD)
              scheme that assigns potential malicious nodes in the network to
              different shards, preventing malicious nodes from gaining a
              dominating influence on the consensus of a single shard. TBSD
              uses a trust-based shard distribution scheme to prevent malicious
              miners from gathering in on one shard by integration of a trust
              management system and genetic algorithm (GA). First, the trust of
              all nodes is computed based on the previous consensus result.
              Then, a GA is used to compute the shard distribution set to
              prevent collusion of malicious miners. The performance evaluation
              shows that the proposed TBSD scheme results in a shard
              distribution with a higher level of fairness than existing
              schemes, which provides an improved level of protection against
              malicious attacks.",

                distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow

                present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that
                preserves longterm security under permissionless operation. It
                ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant
                public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically
                representative shards that process transactions, and by
                introducing an efficient cross-shard commit protocol that

                OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard

              Existing sharding-based protocols rely on reshuffling scheme to

              permissioned blockchain system that improves scalability by
              clustering (partitioning) the nodes and assigning different data

              blockchain is also a distributed system, and as such it shares
              some similarities with distributed database systems. Existing
              works that compare blockchains and distributed database systems

              choices contribute to the overall differences. Our paper is to
              fill this important gap. In this paper, we perform a twin study
              of blockchains and distributed database systems as two types of
              transactional systems. We propose a taxonomy that helps
              illustrate their similarities and differences. In particular, we
              compare the systems along four dimensions: replication,
              concurrency, storage, and sharding. We discuss how the design
              choices have been driven by the system's goals: blockchain's goal
              is security, whereas the distributed database's goal is
              performance. We then conduct an extensive and in-depth
              performance study on two blockchains, namely Quorum and
              Hyperledger Fabric, and three distributed databases, namely
              CockroachDB, TiDB and etcd. We demonstrate how the different
              design choices in the four dimensions lead to different

              blockchain's performance is still lagging far behind that of a
              distributed database. However, the gap is not as significant as
              previously reported, and under high contention or constrained

  abstract = "In a Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE), a group of
              participants aim to randomly choose exactly one leader from the
              group with the restriction that the identity of the leader will
              be known to the chosen leader and nobody else. At a later time,
              the elected leader should be able to publicly reveal her identity
              and prove that she has won the election. The election process
              itself should work properly even if many registered users are
              passive and do not send any messages. Among the many applications
              of SSLEs, their potential for enabling more efficient
              proof-of-stake based cryptocurrencies have recently received
              increased attention. This paper formally defines SSLE schemes and
              presents three constructions that provide varying security and
              performance properties. First, as an existence argument, we show
              how to realize an ideal SSLE using indistinguishability
              obfuscation. Next, we show how to build SSLE from low-depth
              threshold fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE) via a construction
              which can be instantiated with a circuit of multiplicative depth
              as low as 10, for realistically-sized secret leader elections.
              Finally, we show a practical scheme relying on DDH that achieves
              a slightly relaxed notion of security but which boasts extremely
              lightweight computational requirements.",

              a protocol for proving that one spent sequential computational
              work related to some statement. The original motivation for such
              proofs included non-interactive time-stamping and universally
              verifiable CPU benchmarks. A more recent application, and our
              main motivation, are blockchain designs, where proofs of

              proofs of work which are currently used to secure Bitcoin and

              based on a hash function and can be proven secure in the random

  abstract = "Boneh, Bonneau, B{\"u}nz, and Fisch (CRYPTO 2018) recently
              introduced the notion of a verifiable delay function (VDF). VDFs
              are functions that take a long sequential time $T$ to compute,
              but whose outputs $y \get \mathrm\{Eval\}(x)$ can be efficiently
              verified (possibly given a proof $\pi$) in time $t \ll T$ (e.g.,
              $t=\mathrm\{poly\}(\lambda, \log T)$ where $\lambda$ is the
              security parameter). The first security requirement on a VDF is
              that no polynomial-time algorithm can find a convincing proof
              $\pi'$ that verifies for an input $x$ and a different output $y'
              \neq y$. The second security requirement is that that no
              polynomial-time algorithm running in sequential time $T'<T$
              (e.g., $T'=T^\{1/10\}$) can compute $y$. Starting from the work
              of Boneh et al., there are now multiple constructions of VDFs
              from various algebraic assumptions. In this work, we study
              whether VDFs can be constructed from ideal hash functions as
              modeled in the random oracle model (ROM). In the ROM, we measure
              the running time by the number of oracle queries and the
              sequentiality by the number of rounds of oracle queries. We show
              that VDFs satisfying perfect uniqueness (i.e., VDFs where no
              algorithm can find a convincing different solution $y' \neq y$)
              cannot be constructed in the ROM. More formally, we give an
              attacker that finds the solution $y$ in $\approx t$ rounds of
              queries and asking only $\mathrm\{poly\}(T)$ queries in total. In
              addition, we show that a simple adaptation of our techniques can
              be used to rule out tight proofs of sequential work (proofs of
              sequential work are essentially VDFs without the uniqueness

              (PoSTs) and construct an extremely simple, practical protocol for
              implementing these proofs. A PoST allows a prover to convince a
              verifier that she spent a ``space-time'' resource (storing
              data---space---over a period of time). Formally, we define the
              PoST resource as a trade-off between CPU work and space-time
              (under reasonable cost assumptions, a rational user will prefer
              to use the lower-cost space-time resource over CPU work).
              Compared to a proof-of-work, a PoST requires less energy use, as
              the ``difficulty'' can be increased by extending the time period
              over which data is stored without increasing computation costs.
              Our definition is very similar to ``Proofs of Space'' [ePrint
              2013/796, 2013/805] but, unlike the previous definitions, takes
              into account amortization attacks and storage duration. Moreover,
              our protocol uses a very different (and much simpler) technique,
              making use of the fact that we explicitly allow a space-time
              tradeoff, and doesn't require any non-standard assumptions

              protocol allows incremental difficulty adjustment, which can
              gracefully handle increases in the price of storage compared to
              CPU work. In addition, we show how, in a cryptocurrency context,

              latency was not as important as high throughput requirement for
              modular multiplication implementations before. However, with
              recent work on Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs), a necessity for
              the lowest possible latency for modular multiplication
              implementations emerged. VDFs are designed to take a prescribed
              time to realize the underlying computation that can be publicly
              verified. VDF constructions utilize inherently sequential
              arithmetic operations. Efficient VDF constructions have been
              proposed recently, based on time-lock puzzles constructed by
              Rivest, Shamir, and Wagner. An exponentiation operation in an RSA
              group needs to be realized for these VDF constructions. In this
              paper, a modular multiplication algorithm suitable for
              low-latency circuit implementations is proposed and an
              FPGA-optimized variant of this algorithm is presented.",

              flexible consensus mechanism. At its core, DFINITY contains a
              decentralized randomness beacon which acts as a verifiable random
              function (VRF) that produces a stream of outputs over time. The
              novel technique behind the beacon relies on the existence of a
              unique-deterministic, non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold
              signatures scheme. The only known examples of such a scheme are
              pairing-based and derived from BLS. The DFINITY blockchain is
              layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as its
              source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking. A
              ``weight'' is attributed to a chain based on the ranks of the
              leaders who propose the blocks in the chain, and that weight is
              used to select between competing chains. The DFINITY blockchain
              is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the beacon as
              its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking
              blockchain is further hardened by a notarization process which
              dramatically improves the time to finality and eliminates the
              nothing-at-stake and selfish mining attacks. DFINITY consensus
              algorithm is made to scale through continuous quorum selections
              driven by the random beacon. In practice, DFINITY achieves block
              times of a few seconds and transaction finality after only two
              confirmations. The system gracefully handles temporary losses of

              many exciting theoretical approaches in the last few years. Such
              research has often overlapped with the need for private and

              the first practical implementations of such systems. Many of

  abstract = "Ledger-based systems that support rich applications often suffer
              from two limitations. First, validating a transaction requires
              re-executing the state transition that it attests to. Second,
              transactions not only reveal which application had a state
              transition but also reveal the application's internal state. We
              design, implement, and evaluate ZEXE, a ledger-based system where
              users can execute offline computations and subsequently produce
              transactions, attesting to the correctness of these computations,
              that satisfy two main properties. First, transactions *hide all
              information* about the offline computations. Second, transactions
              can be *validated in constant time* by anyone, regardless of the
              offline computation. The core of ZEXE is a construction for a new
              cryptographic primitive that we introduce, *decentralized private
              computation* (DPC) schemes. In order to achieve an efficient
              implementation of our construction, we leverage tools in the area
              of cryptographic proofs, including succinct zero knowledge proofs
              and recursive proof composition. Overall, transactions in ZEXE
              are 968 bytes regardless of the offline computation, and
              generating them takes less than a minute plus a time that grows
              with the offline computation. We demonstrate how to use ZEXE to
              realize privacy-preserving analogues of popular applications:
              private decentralized exchanges for user-defined fungible assets

               systems with a potential to support business applications. There
               are numerous different suggestions on how to implement such
               systems. However, before legal p2p systems can become mainstream
               they need to offer improved efficiency, robustness, and
               stability. While Chord is the most researched and best
               understood mechanism, the Kademlia algorithm is widely-used in
               deployed applications. There are still many open questions
               concerning the performance of the latter. In this paper we
               identify the main problems of Kademlia by large scale
               simulations and present modifications which help to avoid those
               problems. This way, we are able to significantly improve the
               performance and robustness of Kademlia-based applications,
               especially in times of churn and in unstable states. In
               particular, we show how to increase the stability of the
               overlay, make searches more efficient, and adapt the maintenance
               traffic to the current churn rate in a self-organizing way.",

               instructions, dubbed AVX512IFMA, that carry out Integer Fused
               Multiply Accumulate operations. These instructions operate on
               512-bit registers and compute eight independent 52-bit unsigned
               integer multiplications, to generate eight 104-bit products, and
               accumulate their low/high halves into 64-bit containers. Using
               these instructions requires that inputs are converted to
               (redundant form) radix 252, and outputs are converted to the
               desired representation. This paper demonstrates several
               techniques for leveraging the AVX512IFMA instructions in order
               to speed up big-integer multiplications. Although processors
               that support AVX512IFMA are not yet available at the time this
               paper is written, we show how currently available public tools
               can be used for estimating their potential performance benefits.
               For example, based on these tools, we expect a 2x speedup for
               1024-bit integer multiplication, over the best currently
               available method.",

               lottery scheme in which winners are chosen fairly using only
               internal information. Since all this information may be
               published (even before the lottery closes), anyone can do the
               calculation and therefore verify that the winner was chosen
               correctly. Since the calculation uses a delaying function,
               ticket purchasers cannot take advantage of this information.
               Fraud on the part of the lottery agent is detectable and no
               single ticket purchaser needs to be trusted. Coalitions of
               purchasers attempting to control the winning ticket calculation

               electromagnetic spectrum, and optical power basics, this book
               offers an in-depth discussion of optic receivers, optical
               transmitters and amplifiers. The text discusses attenuation,
               transmission losses, optical sources such as semiconductor light
               emitting diodes, and lasers, providing several
               dispersion-management schemes that restore the amplified signal
               to its original state. Topics are discussed in a structured
               manner, with definitions, explanations, examples, illustrations,
               and informative facts. Extensive pedagogical features, such as
               numerical problems, review questions, multiple choice questions,
               and student-focussed learning objectives, are also provided.
               Mathematical derivations and geometrical representations are
               included where necessary. This text will be useful for
               undergraduate and graduate students of electronics,

               estimating the geographic location of arbitrary Internet hosts.
               We motivate our work by showing that 1) existing approaches,
               based on end-to-end delay measurements from a set of landmarks,
               fail to outperform much simpler techniques, and 2) the error of
               these approaches is strongly determined by the distance to the
               nearest landmark, even when triangulation is used to combine
               estimates from different landmarks. Our approach improves on
               these earlier techniques by leveraging network topology, along
               with measurements of network delay, to constrain host position.
               We convert topology and delay data into a set of constraints,
               then solve for router and host locations simultaneously. This
               approach improves the consistency of location estimates,
               reducing the error substantially for structured networks in our
               experiments on Abilene and Sprint. For networks with
               insufficient structural constraints, our techniques integrate
               external hints that are validated using measurements before
               being trusted. Together, these techniques lower the median

               A wide range of applications make it very popular and backbone
               of technology system i.e. GSM, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc. In order to
               categorization of applications, this network gives a unique

               fixed natured use to deploy into remote areas for sensing and
               processing desire information. Due to distributed and open
               natured of wireless networks, it is vulnerable and prone for
               attacked to intercept and hijack network communication. Its
               deployment in remote areas requires more concern of security
               issues. Open natured communication be a magnet for attacker to
               intercept and catch the sensed information. Numerous security
               threats can adversely affect its functioning \& degrade network
               performance. The problem becomes more critical when it deploy
               for defense mission. Arbitrary network failure or node failure
               is the natural phenomena and may vary as per real life
               deployment, but intentional failure or compromising network may
               lead to leak the information. A various security threats like
               Worm-hole attack, Black-hole Attack, Gray-hole attack, Sybil
               Attack etc. are used for packet dropping, capturing and
               degrading network performance. Security in mobile networks is a

               security overhead create cumbersome situation for detection and
               prevention mechanism. The complete study observes that, security
               threats not only capture the packets but also degrade network
               performance. To overcome vulnerability problems, work considers
               wormhole attack as study target and will derive mechanism to
               identify and prevent mobile networks from security threat. A
               wormhole attack is very popular and applies on network layer by

                   between when a transaction is broadcast and when it is
                   confirmed (the so-called, confirmation latency). While
                   improvements in consensus techniques can lead to lower
                   confirmation latency, a fundamental lower bound on
                   confirmation latency is the propagation latency of messages
                   through the underlying peer-to-peer (p2p) network
                   (inBitcoin, the propagation latency is several tens of
                   seconds). The de facto p2p protocol used by Bitcoin and
                   other blockchains is based on random connectivity: each node
                   connects to a random subset of nodes. The induced p2p
                   network topology can be highly suboptimal since it neglects
                   geographical distance, differences in bandwidth, hash-power
                   and computational abilities across peers. We present
                   Perigee, a decentralized algorithm that automatically learns
                   an efficient p2p topology tuned to the aforementioned
                   network heterogeneities, purely based on peers' interactions
                   with their neighbors. Motivated by the literature on the
                   multi-armed bandit problem, Perigee optimally balances the
                   tradeoff between retaining connections to known
                   well-connected neighbors, and exploring new connections to
                   previously-unseen neighbors. Experimental evaluations show
                   that Perigee reduces the latency to broadcast by $33\%$.
                   Lastly Perigee is simple, computationally lightweight,
                   adversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish
                   interests of peers, making it an attractive p2p protocol for
                   blockchains.",

                   introduced by Zhandry for analyzing quantum algorithms in
                   the quantum random oracle model (QROM). To start off with,
                   we offer a concise exposition of the technique, which easily
                   extends to the parallel-query QROM, where in each
                   query-round the considered algorithm may make several
                   queries to the QROM in parallel. This variant of the QROM
                   allows for a more fine-grained query-complexity analysis.
                   Our main technical contribution is a framework that
                   simplifies the use of (the parallel-query generalization of)
                   the compressed oracle technique for proving query complexity
                   results. With our framework in place, whenever applicable,
                   it is possible to prove quantum query complexity lower
                   bounds by means of purely classical reasoning. More than
                   that, for typical examples the crucial classical
                   observations that give rise to the classical bounds are
                   sufficient to conclude the corresponding quantum bounds. We
                   demonstrate this on a few examples, recovering known results
                   (like the optimality of parallel Grover), but also obtaining
                   new results (like the optimality of parallel BHT collision
                   search). Our main target is the hardness of finding a
                   $q$-chain with fewer than $q$ parallel queries, i.e., a
                   sequence $x_0, x_1,\ldots, x_q$ with $x_i = H(x_\{i-1\})$
                   for all $1 \leq i \leq q$. The above problem of finding a
                   hash chain is of fundamental importance in the context of
                   proofs of sequential work. Indeed, as a concrete
                   cryptographic application of our techniques, we prove that
                   the ``Simple Proofs of Sequential Work'' proposed by Cohen
                   and Pietrzak remains secure against quantum attacks. Such an
                   analysis is not simply a matter of plugging in our new
                   bound; the entire protocol needs to be analyzed in the light
                   of a quantum attack. Thanks to our framework, this can now
                   be done with purely classical reasoning.",

              interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlays because
              they provide a good substrate for creating large-scale data
              sharing, content distribution and application-level multicast

              efﬁcient search/location of data items, data permanence or
              guarantees, hierarchical naming, trust and authentication, and,

               Through a precomputation, the core cMix protocol eliminates all
               expensive real- time public-key operations---at the senders,
               recipients and mixnodes---thereby decreasing real-time
               cryptographic latency and lowering computational costs for
               clients. The core real-time phase performs only a few fast
               modular multiplica- tions. In these times of surveillance and
               extensive profiling there is a great need for an anonymous
               communication system that resists global attackers. One widely
               rec- ognized solution to the challenge of traffic analysis is a
               mixnet, which anonymizes a batch of messages by sending the
               batch through a fixed cascade of mixnodes. Mixnets can offer
               excellent privacy guarantees, including unlinkability of sender
               and receiver, and resistance to many traffic-analysis attacks
               that undermine many other approaches including onion routing.
               Existing mixnet designs, however, suf- fer from high latency in
               part because of the need for real-time public-key opera- tions.
               Precomputation greatly improves the real-time performance of
               cMix, while its fixed cascade of mixnodes yields the strong
               anonymity guarantees of mixnets. cMix is unique in not requiring
               any real-time public-key operations by users. Consequently, cMix
               is the first mixing suitable for low latency chat for light-
               weight devices. Our presentation includes a specification of
               cMix, security arguments, anonymity analysis, and a performance
               comparison with selected other approaches. We also give
               benchmarks from our prototype.",

                network architectures to be both accurate and low cost. This
                paper explores semantic specialization as a mechanism for
                improving the computational efﬁciency (accuracyper-unit-cost)
                of inference in the context of image classiﬁcation.
                Speciﬁcally, we propose a network architecture template called
                HydraNet, which enables state-of-the-art architectures for
                image classiﬁcation to be transformed into dynamic
                architectures which exploit conditional execution for efﬁcient
                inference. HydraNets are wide networks containing distinct
                components specialized to compute features for visually similar
                classes, but they retain efﬁciency by dynamically selecting
                only a small number of components to evaluate for any one input
                image. This design is made possible by a soft gating mechanism
                that encourages component specialization during training and
                accurately performs component selection during inference. We
                evaluate the HydraNet approach on both the CIFAR-100 and
                ImageNet classiﬁcation tasks. On CIFAR, applying the HydraNet
                template to the ResNet and DenseNet family of models reduces
                inference cost by 2-4$\times$ while retaining the accuracy of
                the baseline architectures. On ImageNet, applying the HydraNet
                template improves accuracy up to 2.5\% when compared to an
                efﬁcient baseline architecture with similar inference cost.",

               concurrency, interwoven in four-and-a-half decades of an
               evolving industry: from the introduction of the first personal
               computer to an era when parallel and distributed multiprocessors
               are abundant. His works lay formal foundations for concurrent
               computations executed by interconnected computers. Some of the
               algorithms have become standard engineering practice for fault
               tolerant distributed computing - distributed systems that
               continue to function correctly despite failures of individual
               components. He also developed a substantial body of work on the
               formal specification and verification of concurrent systems, and
               has contributed to the development of automated tools applying
               these methods. Part I consists of technical chapters of the book
               and a biography. The technical chapters of this book present a
               retrospective on Lamport's original ideas from experts in the
               field. Through this lens, it portrays their long-lasting impact.
               The chapters cover timeless notions Lamport introduced: the
               Bakery algorithm, atomic shared registers and sequential
               consistency; causality and logical time; Byzantine Agreement;
               state machine replication and Paxos; temporal logic of actions
               (TLA). The professional biography tells of Lamport's career,
               providing the context in which his work arose and broke new
               grounds, and discusses LaTeX - perhaps Lamport's most
               influential contribution outside the field of concurrency. This
               chapter gives a voice to the people behind the achievements,
               notably Lamport himself, and additionally the colleagues around
               him, who inspired, collaborated, and helped him drive worldwide
               impact. Part II consists of a selection of Leslie Lamport's most
               influential papers. This book touches on a lifetime of
               contributions by Leslie Lamport to the field of concurrency and
               on the extensive influence he had on people working in the
               field. It will be of value to historians of science, and to
               researchers and students who work in the area of concurrency and

               an attacker creates a large number of identities and uses them
               to control a substantial fraction of the system. We propose
               Persea, a novel P2P system that derives its Sybil resistance by
               assigning IDs through a bootstrap tree, the graph of how nodes
               have joined the system through invitations. Unlike prior
               Sybil-resistant P2P systems based on social networks, Persea
               does not rely on two key assumptions: (1) that the social
               network is fast mixing and (2) that there is a small ratio of
               attack edges to honest nodes. Both assumptions have been shown
               to be unreliable in real social networks. A node joins Persea
               when it gets an invitation from an existing node in the system.
               The inviting node assigns a node ID to the joining node and
               gives it a chunk of node IDs for further distribution. For each
               chunk of ID space, the attacker needs to socially engineer a
               connection to another node already in the system. The
               hierarchical distribution of node IDs confines a large attacker
               botnet to a considerably smaller region of the ID space than in
               a normal P2P system. We then build upon this hierarchical ID
               space to make a distributed hash table (DHT) based on the Kad
               network. The Persea DHT uses a replication mechanism in which
               each (key, value) pair is stored in nodes that are evenly spaced
               over the network. Thus, even if a given region is occupied by
               attackers, the desired (key, value pair can be retrieved from
               other regions. We evaluate Persea in analysis and in simulations
               with social network datasets and show that it provides better
               lookup success rates than prior work with modest overheads.",

              shown to be notoriously difficult to protect against security

  author   = "Meckler, Izaak and Shapiro, Evan",
  abstract = "We present Coda, the ﬁrst cryptocurrency protocol that remains
              decentralized at scale. ``Scalability'' refers to Coda's ability
              to handle throughput of thousands of transactions per second.
              ``Decentralization'' refers to the accessibility of verifying the
              chain state and synchronizing as a new user. Synchronizing the
              chain state with Coda requires receiving less than a megabyte of
              data, allowing devices like smartphones to securely perform
              transactions independent of how long the protocol has been
              running or how many transactions have been performed.
              Transactions on Coda can also be veriﬁed independent of their
              complexity, allowing complex computations on its blockchain
              without burdening the network. Coda achieves these features

              of History (PoH) - a proof for verifying order and passage of

              time into a ledger - an append only data structure. When used
              alongside a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or
              Proof of Stake (PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a
              Byzantine Fault Tolerant replicated state machine, resulting in
              sub-second finality times. This paper also proposes two

                   need for verifiable computation has grown increasingly
                   urgent. The concept of verifiable computation enables a weak
                   client to outsource difficult computations to a powerful,
                   but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation
                   aim to provide the client with a guarantee that the server
                   performed the requested computations correctly, without
                   requiring the client to perform the computations herself. By
                   design, these protocols impose a minimal computational
                   burden on the client. However, existing protocols require
                   the server to perform a large amount of extra bookkeeping in
                   order to enable a client to easily verify the results.
                   Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical
                   curiosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in
                   real cloud computing systems. Our goal is to leverage GPUs
                   to reduce the server-side slowdown for verifiable
                   computation. To this end, we identify abundant data
                   parallelism in a state-of-the-art general-purpose protocol
                   for verifiable computation, originally due to Goldwasser,
                   Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by Cormode,
                   Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the
                   GPU, obtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a
                   state-of-the-art sequential implementation. For benchmark
                   problems, our implementation reduces the slowdown of the
                   server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original
                   computations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce
                   the already small runtime of the client by 100x. Similarly,
                   we obtain 20-50x server-side and client-side speedups for
                   related protocols targeted at specific streaming problems.
                   We believe our results demonstrate the immediate
                   practicality of using GPUs for verifiable computation, and
                   more generally that protocols for verifiable computation
                   have become sufficiently mature to deploy in real cloud
                   computing systems.",

              an economically viable alternative to traditional content
              delivery approaches: the feasibility studies conducted for
              several large content providers suggested a remarkable potential
              of peer-assisted content delivery networks to reduce the burden
              of user requests on content delivery servers and several
              commercial peer-assisted deployments have been recently
              introduced. Yet there are many technical and commercial
              challenges which question the future of peer-assisted solutions
              in industrial settings. This includes among others unreliability
              of peer-to-peer networks, the lack of incentives for peers'
              participation, and copyright issues. In this paper, we carefully
              review and systematize this ongoing debate around the future of
              peer-assisted networks and propose a novel taxonomy to
              characterize the research and industrial efforts in the area. To
              this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the last decade in
              the peer-assisted content delivery research and devise a novel
              taxonomy to characterize the identified challenges and the
              respective proposed solutions in the literature. Our survey
              includes a thorough review of the three very large scale
              feasibility studies conducted for BBC iPlayer, MSN Video and
              Conviva, five large commercial peer-assisted CDNs - Kankan,
              LiveSky, Akamai NetSession, Spotify, Tudou - and a vast scope of
              technical papers. We focus both on technical challenges in
              deploying peer-assisted solutions and also on non-technical
              challenges caused due to heterogeneity in user access patterns
              and distribution of resources among users as well as commercial
              feasibility related challenges attributed to the necessity of
              accounting for the interests and incentives of Internet Service
              Providers, End-Users and Content Providers. The results of our
              study suggest that many of technical challenges for implementing
              peer-assisted content delivery networks on an industrial scale
              have been already addressed in the literature, whereas a problem
              of finding economically viable solutions to incentivize
              participation in peer-assisted schemes remains an open issue to a
              large extent. Furthermore, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT)

  author   = "Nwebonyi, Francis N and Martins, Rolando and Correia, Manuel E",
  abstract = "Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks have gained popularity due to
              their robustness, cost advantage, network efficiency and
              openness. Unfortunately, the same properties that foster their
              success, also make them prone to several attacks. To mitigate
              these attacks, several scalable security mechanisms which are
              based on the concepts of trust and reputation have been proposed.
              These proposed methods tend to ignore some core practical
              requirements that are essential to make them more useful in the
              real world. Some of such requirements include efficient
              bootstrapping of each newcomer's reputation, and mitigating
              seeder(s) exploitation. Additionally, although interaction among
              participating peers is usually the bases for reputation, the
              importance given to the frequency of interaction between the
              peers is often minimized or ignored. This can result in
              situations where barely known peers end-up having similar trust
              scores to the well-known and consistently cooperative nodes.
              After a careful review of the literature, this work proposes a
              novel and scalable reputation based security mechanism that
              addresses the aforementioned problems. The new method offers more
              efficient reputation bootstrapping, mitigation of bandwidth
              attack and better management of interaction rate, which further
              leads to improved fairness. To evaluate its performance, the new
              reputation model has been implemented as an extension of the
              BitTorrent protocol. Its robustness was tested by exposing it to
              popular malicious behaviors in a series of extensive PeerSim
              simulations. Results show that the proposed method is very robust
              and can efficiently mitigate popular attacks on P2P overlay

               contribution to the development of generally applicable
               decentralized bootstrap mechanisms, in this paper we analyze two
               decentralized approaches from a practical point of view. We
               consider local host caches and random address probing for
               bootstrapping into the BitTorrent DHT as an example for a widely
               deployed P2P system. Based on the results of an extensive
               measurement study we show that local host caches allow rejoining
               the P2P system quickly after short times of disconnection, but
               are impracticable for infrequent or first-time users.
               Furthermore, random address probing is feasible using a direct
               Internet connection with high bandwidth, but is subject to
               practical issues raised by typical NAT routers and the
               distribution of ports used by BitTorrent clients. We propose two
               mechanisms for increasing the performance of random address
               probing: (1) probing multiple ports per host and (2) hash-based
               filter-resistant port selection, making distributed
               bootstrapping feasible even from a practical point of view.",

               minimal privacy protections from nosy neighbors offered by
               conventional banking. Unfortunately, at 25 KB, the

               Given this freedom, we explore several techniques for
               drastically reducing proof size while ensuring that forging a
               single zerocoin is more difficult than the block mining process

                   However, they possess the drawbacks of low transaction
                   throughput and long approval time. These problems can be
                   addressed by shortening the block generation interval;
                   however, shortening this interval alone has the effect of
                   increasing the frequency of forks. In this study, we aim to
                   shorten the block generation interval without increasing the
                   fork generation rate by improving the network topology of
                   the nodes and shortening the propagation time. We propose a

                   sharing. Recently, a new peer-to-peer solution called the
                   InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has attracted attention,
                   which promises to re-decentralise the Web. Being
                   increasingly used as a stand-alone application, IPFS has
                   also emerged as the technical backbone of various other
                   decentralised solutions and was even used to evade
                   censorship. Decentralised applications serving millions of
                   users rely on IPFS as one of their crucial building blocks.
                   This popularity makes IPFS attractive for large-scale
                   attacks. We have identified a conceptual issue in one of
                   IPFS's core libraries and demonstrate their exploitation by
                   means of a successful end-to-end attack. We evaluated this
                   attack against the IPFS reference implementation on the
                   public IPFS network, which is used by the average user to
                   share and consume IPFS content. Results obtained from
                   mounting this attack on live IPFS nodes show that arbitrary
                   IPFS nodes can be eclipsed, i.e. isolated from the network,

              claims is instead derived from traditional centralized

               trustworthiness and predicting the future behavior of nodes in a
               large-scale distributed system where nodes may transact with one
               another without prior knowledge or experience. One of the
               fundamental challenges in distributed reputation management is
               to understand vulnerabilities and develop mechanisms that can
               minimize the potential damages to a system by malicious nodes.
               In this paper, we identify three vulnerabilities that are
               detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose
               TrustGuard - a safeguard framework for providing a highly
               dependable and yet efficient reputation system. First, we
               provide a dependable trust model and a set of formal methods to
               handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their
               behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. Second, a
               transaction based reputation system must cope with the
               vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by
               flooding feedbacks with fake transactions. Third, but not least,
               we identify the importance of filtering out dishonest feedbacks
               when computing reputation-based trust of a node, including the
               feedbacks filed by malicious nodes through collusion. Our
               experiments show that, comparing with existing reputation
               systems, our framework is highly dependable and effective in
               countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating
               behavior, flooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions,

               (i.e., covering attacks beyond relaying) stemming from the
               authentication dimension in distance bounding. Advanced aspects
               of distance-bounding security are also covered. We conclude by
               presenting what we consider to be the most important challenges
               in distance bounding.",

  abstract  = "Tor is a peer-to-peer overlay routing network that achieves
               unlinkable communication between source and destination.Unlike
               traditional mix-nets, Tor seeks to balance anonymity and
               performance, particularly with respect to providing low-latency
               communication. As a result, understanding the latencies between
               peers in the Tor network could be an extremely powerful tool in
               understanding and improving Tor's performance and anonymity
               properties. Unfortunately, there are no practical techniques for
               inferring accurate latencies between two arbitrary hosts on the
               Internet, and Tor clients are not instrumented to collect and
               report on these measurements. In this paper, we present Ting, a
               technique for measuring latencies between arbitrary Tor nodes
               from a single vantage point. Through a ground-truth validation,
               we show that Ting is accurate, even with few samples, and does
               not require modifications to existing clients. We also apply
               Ting to the live Tor network, and show that its measurements are
               stable over time. We demonstrate that the all-pairs latency
               datasets that Ting permits can be applied in disparate ways,
               including faster methods of deanonymizing Tor circuits and
               efficiently finding long circuits with low end-to-end latency.",

@ARTICLE{Zave2015-jx,
  title         = "How to Make Chord Correct",
  author        = "Zave, Pamela",
  abstract      = "The Chord distributed hash table (DHT) is well-known and
                   frequently used to implement peer-to-peer systems. Chord
                   peers find other peers, and access their data, through a
                   ring-shaped pointer structure in a large identifier space.
                   Despite claims of proven correctness, i.e., eventual
                   reachability, previous work has shown that the Chord
                   ring-maintenance protocol is not correct under its original
                   operating assumptions. It has not, however, discovered
                   whether Chord could be made correct with reasonable
                   operating assumptions. The contribution of this paper is to
                   provide the first specification of correct operations and
                   initialization for Chord, an inductive invariant that is
                   necessary and sufficient to support a proof of correctness,
                   and the proof itself. Most of the proof is carried out by
                   automated analysis of an Alloy model. The inductive
                   invariant reflects the fact that a Chord network must have a
                   minimum ring size (the minimum being the length of successor
                   lists plus one) to be correct. The invariant relies on an
                   assumption that there is a stable base, of the minimum size,
                   of permanent ring members. Because a stable base has only a
                   few members and a Chord network can have millions, we learn
                   that the obstacles to provable correctness are anomalies in
                   small networks, and that a stable base need not be
                   maintained once a Chord network grows large.",

  abstract = "Location-based services (LBSs) assume that users are willing to
              release trustworthy and useful details about their whereabouts.
              However, many location privacy concerns have arisen. For location
              privacy protection, several algorithms build a cloaking region to
              hide a user's location. However, many applications may not
              operate adequately on cloaked locations. For example, a
              traditional distance bounding protocol (DBP)---which is run by
              two nodes called the prover and the verifier---may conclude an
              untight and useless distance between these two entities. An LBS
              (verifier) may use this distance as a metric of usefulness and
              trustworthiness of the location claimed by the user (prover).
              However, we show that if a tight distance is desired, traditional
              DBP can refine a user's cloaked location and compromise its
              location privacy. To find a proper balance, we propose a
              location-privacy-aware DBP protocol. Our solution consists of
              adding some small delays before submitting any user's response.
              We show that several issues arise when a certain delay is chosen,
              and we propose some solutions. The effectiveness of our
              techniques in balancing location refinement and utility is
              demonstrated through simulation.",
