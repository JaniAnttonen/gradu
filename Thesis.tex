%
% Last mod 2.9.2015:
% 
% Why:
%  - No need for anyone to invent the wheel again. You can of course do that
%    if you wish - TeX'll even let you invent many different kinds of wheels
%  - That said, if you come up with a great new wheel I'd like to hear about 
%    it - it might even end up being used here 
% 
% Features:
%  - Proper page sizes as required by university guide for students:
%      - proper font sizes as well as linespacings
%      - proper size of margins
%  - Generic title page:
%      - \gentitle
%  - Generic abstract page(s):
%      - \begin{itabstract}{Keywords}
%          abstract text
%        \end{itabstract}
%      - \begin{ittiivis}...\end{ittiivis} provides finnish version
%         - ittiivis defaults to finnish so no need to issue 
%           \selectlanguage{finnish}
%      - total number of pages as well as total number of pages in appendices
%        are automagically handled
%  - Entry environment:
%      - \begin{entry}[widest label]
%          \item[1st label text] ...
%          \item[2nd label text] ...
%        \end{entry}
%      - the actual items are aligned to suit the widest label, which is
%        given as an argument to the environment
%  - Use of specific latex packages to ease in formatting the thesis:
%      - format table of contents to have bibliography shown as references
%        as well as other fixes           (tocbibind)
%      - enhanced verbatim handling       (sverb)
%      - source code inclusion            (listings)
%      - handling of headers and footers  (fancyhdr)
%
%      - consultation of the manuals of these packages is strongly
%        encouraged 
%
% Assumptions:
%  - itpackage.sty file is available 
%  - each chapter is as a separate file which is read in with e.g. \input
%   
% Miscellaneous:
%  - comments are welcome
%  - should a required package be missing see http://www.ctan.org/ 
%  - http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf
